        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pierogi are classic Polish dumplings, made by wrapping dough around a savory filling and then boiling. This quick and easy, semi-homemade meal takes advantage of store-bought frozen pierogi for a no-boil, one-pot dish that comes together in about 40 minutes. Sweet caramelized onions, pan-browned kielbasa sausage, and a sprinkle of fresh herbs make this quick, cozy dish pop on the plate. For the best results, you'll need a 12-inch nonstick frying pan. If you don't have a nonstick pan this big, you can use a regular frying pan, but you'll need more oil, you'll have to handle the pierogi carefully, and they may break apart a bit.</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. black pepper</li>
            <li>1 kielbasa sausage</li>
            <li>1 1/4 lb. pierogi</li>
            <li>sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-low heat. (If you donâ€™t have a nonstick pan this size, you can use a regular 12-inch or 14-inch frying pan, but add more oil to help prevent sticking.) Add onion, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula, until onion is soft and just beginning to brown, 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high. Add kielbasa to the pan and spread them out, keeping them in direct contact with the pan as much as possible. Cook, stirring and turning kielbasa occasionally, until sausage begins to brown on both sides and is heated through, 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add pierogi and water to the pan and cook, covered, until the water has evaporated and a fork can easily pierce through the center of a pierogi, 5-6 minutes. Remove lid and decrease the heat to medium. Add the remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and continue cooking uncovered, stirring occasionally, until pierogi are golden brown, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon the pierogi, kielbasa, and onion onto plates. Scatter parsley on top and serve with a dollop of sour cream and some sauerkraut.</li>
