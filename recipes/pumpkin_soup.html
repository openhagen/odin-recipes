        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This easy creamy pumpkin soup recipe is one of the best fall recipes ever. I made it with roasted pumpkin and it came out super tasty and flavorful, and believe it or not, itâ€™s vegan.</p>
        <h4>Ingridients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lb. pumpkin</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1/3 cup coconut milk</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. cumin powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 360F/180C and line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place the pumpkin and garlic cloves in, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil, then, with your hands, mix to coat.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the pumpkin is fork tender.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in a pot and saute the onions together with carrots and celery, for 3-4 minutes, until they soften. Add in the cashew and pumpkin, then squeeze in garlic from its skin.</li>
            <li>Pour the stock in and simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add coconut milk, cumin and cinnamon powder, then stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Using a hand blender, blend until smooth.</li>
        </ol>
