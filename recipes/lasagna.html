        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Classic Lasagna recipe that <em>everyone</em> should have in their go-to recipe collection! This is a wonderful, classic lasagna recipe – nothing too fancy, just layers of pasta, meat sauce, a ricotta cheese mixture, and mozzarella – and it’s one that everyone should have in their own recipe collection!</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 tsp. oregano</li>
            <li>1 lb. lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup onions</li>
            <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>28 oz. crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 lb. sausages</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a strainer with cheese cloth and place over a bowl. Place the ricotta in cheesecloth lined strainer and cover the top with more cheesecloth. Then place a heavy object over the top to press the ricotta. This process will remove some of the liquid from the ricotta cheese.</li>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to box directions but keep them slightly undercooked (cook approximately 7-8 minutes). They should still have a good bite to them. Rinse and cool. Keep moist while you prepare the rest of the dish.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and cook the onions for about two minutes over medium high heat. Add the garlic and cook one more minute. Add the meat, stir and cook until there is no pink. Depending on the fat content of the meat you are using, you may need to drain off some liquid. There should only be a few tablespoons of liquid after cooking the meat. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes and mint. Reduce to medium and simmer ten minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix drained ricotta, 1 cup shredded mozzarella, beaten eggs, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper and the chopped parsley. Mix to combine and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees and put oven rack in center of oven.</li>
        </ol>
